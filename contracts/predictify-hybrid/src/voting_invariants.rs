//! # Proptest invariant tests for VotingManager total-stake conservation
//!
//! Issue #607: These property tests assert that for any sequence of valid votes
//! the following invariant always holds:
//!
//!   sum(outcome_distribution.values()) == market.total_staked == VotingStats.total_staked
//!
//! Tests cover:
//! - Sequential single-outcome votes
//! - Multi-outcome distribution across outcomes
//! - Duplicate-user votes (second vote is silently ignored by the contract)
//! - Zero-stake votes (rejected, total_staked stays unchanged)
//!
//! Strategy: We operate directly on `Market` and `VotingUtils` (unit level) to
//! avoid the oracle/token infrastructure required by the full contract client.
//! `MarketStateManager::add_vote` is the same code path called by
//! `VotingManager::process_vote`, so this covers the bookkeeping invariant.
